# shoe Collection
This project is a simple app for tracking all the shoes that I have in my shoe closet. Eventually, I would love to add a user login/logoff feature so that other people can add comments or I can add a shopping cart if there are some shoes for sale. However, for now this is an app simply for tracking my own personal collection.

## Objectives
My frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My frontend communicates with a backend API that I built with Ruby and Rails.

  - Design and architect features across frontend and backend
  - Integrate JavaScript and Rails

## dependency
